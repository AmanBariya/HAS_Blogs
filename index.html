                <span>March 25th, 2023</span>
                <p>It was about the day in the middle of exams. We were outside finding the house to rent
                    tired of the day I later decided to go to the Brewery cafe, Vadodara. Mind blowing place to
                    visit. Loved the vibe of the place and the calming atmosphere made me forget the stress and
                    tiredness of the day.

                <p>It was around 4AM of night in the mid of winters. The dew had covered around the whole city.
                    It was a bit creepy but really amazing to see. I took this photo with my canon camera and I cant
                    experience how happy I felt waking up so early and got this amazing pic.

                <p>Girnar hills, the day I still remeber the way I spent it. I and my best friend Harsh
                    tired of 12th exam and before starting our journey to college decided to go on a vaction as a
                    duo trip for five days. On our way we stopped in Junagadh and early in the morning climbed the
                    Girnar Hills. We completed the visit of piligrimage and then Harsh got maggie for us. The atmosphere
                    added a special taste to that maggie... Yummy!!!

                    you can feel like the sun in lying on the top of the tree like a star on the top of a
                    christmas tree, and this makes the photo so beautiful to understand.
